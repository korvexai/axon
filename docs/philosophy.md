# Axon Philosophy
Axon is built on the principle of **Independent AI Infrastructure**.

We believe AI should be:
1. **Local:** No data leaves the owner's hardware.
2. **Modular:** Swap components without breaking the system.
3. **Performant:** Built in Rust to ensure minimal overhead.
4. **Sovereign:** Freedom from cloud API lock-in and pricing.
